                        <br>
                        <p>First and foremost, immense credit and appreciation to my friend Mai Khánh Huyền for helping me redesign the "Home" page interface (the lovely icon and banner!)
                        and for creating the color palette that serves as the foundation for the aesthetic of this entire website. Your creativity has
                        truly elevated the visual appeal of the page, making it look far more beautiful than I could have imagined. This acknowledgment is a
                        testament to both your artistic skills and your kindness.</p>
                        <p>But even more than that, thank you for always being there for me, especially during the lowest points of my life. While it may be
                        impossible for anyone to fully grasp the depth of my struggles and inner conflicts, your presence has been a source of immense comfort
                        and strength.</p>
                        <p>Much love to you, my dear friend. As I've always said, you are the one blessing that high school brought into my life. I hope that one day, we can both confidently tell each other that we are truly happy.</p>

                        <h4>Closing Remarks</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>This webpage has truly consumed a significant amount of effort and determination. Even though the requirements only called for a simple homepage, I pushed myself to go above and beyond to create something I’m genuinely satisfied with and proud of. I suppose that’s just who I am — if it doesn’t align with my vision, I won’t even begin it. Otherwise, there is no point at all, don't you agree?</p>
                        <p>The task was indeed challenging, especially when you know that there are countless freely available content management systems that allow people to publish dynamic websites (this web page is sadly static but I don't plan on being involved in web design anyway) without ever touching a line of code. It makes sitting down and building a webpage from scratch (even with the help of powerful frameworks like Bootstrap or fantastic tools like ChatGPT) feel particularly painstaking. But I’m glad I saw it through, and the experience I gained in the process (about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Responsive Web Design) was, in the end, worth it — well, somewhat worth it ;-;.</p>
                        <p>I hope this project impresses those who visit it, especially the esteemed reviewers of my lab application :))). It will surely sooth the regrets that have been bothering me.</p>
                        <p>Oh, and maybe you would want to change the screen size to see the Responsive Design of this web page. Maybe you would then appreciate this more.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your time!</p>

                        <h4>About my lab application</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>While I initially intended to make closing remarks, I would like to take a moment to elaborate on my motivation for applying to the lab.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, I have always envisioned myself getting involved in research, regardless of my field of study. Before delving into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I considered pursuing Biotechnology and Drug Discovery, as well as Space Science and Satellite Technology. All of these areas offer immense potential for in-depth research. I am excited by the prospect of new discoveries and recognize that pursuing meaningful research can be challenging. Nonetheless, I am eager to embark on this journey and actively contribute rather than remain passive in my pursuits. This represents the first step in my commitment to personal growth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, my decision to apply to this particular lab stems from my keen interest in AI and machine learning, which I believe aligns with the lab&rsquo;s focus. While other labs may incorporate machine learning as a secondary element, I am drawn to the opportunity to engage deeply in this area. Admittedly, I am not as enthusiastic about the business applications of AI at this stage; my primary goal is to gain foundational experience in AI and machine learning before determining how I will apply that knowledge in the future&mdash;without any limitations.</p>
                        <p>However, I want to assure you that I will respect the lab&rsquo;s orientation and work diligently to fit in with all members of the team.</p>
                        <p>Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to your response.</p>
