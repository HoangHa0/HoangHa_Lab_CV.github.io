                                <p>Starting my journey in Computer Science with CS50 turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. Within just 15 minutes of the first lecture, I understood why this course has been recommended for years as the introductory course for tech enthusiasts who want to immerse themselves in the field.</p>
                                <p>Because this is what true inspiration looks like!</p>
                                <p>Amid thousands of courses out there that teach programming languages in a mechanical, rote manner, this gem delivers the true essence of problem-solving using computers. It doesn’t ask you to solve theoretical problems like checking for prime numbers in a long list of elements or solving complex equations faster than others (which, while not inherently bad, often stifles beginners’ creativity and limits the scope of learning to only a few gifted individuals). Instead, the course lets you dive into real-world applications — you see and practice how image filters work, how to manipulate audio files, and how to implement algorithms to check credit card validity or determine the reading grade of a book. You even learn how to recover data from a memory card, use SQL databases, and solve problems through creative games like Fiftyville. </p>
                                <p>You don't just solve practical problems — you gain a deeper understanding of how the world and technology function and evolve.</p>
                                <p>I also have no doubt that many people wish they had the privilege of learning from great teachers who possess even a fraction of the enthusiasm and professionalism that Professor David J. Malan exudes. It reminds me of when Bill Gates spoke of Richard Feynman as "the best teacher I never had."</p>
                                <p>I can’t help but imagine that someone taking part in this course today might one day revolutionize the field.</p>

                                <p>Looking back, this was truly a hilarious experience. There was a time when I thought there was no chance in a million years that I would attend the National Economics University. There is really no tell of the future as they say, I figured.</p>
                                <p>Not long after the graduation exam results were announced, I came down with a fever that lasted a whole week. In a haze and unable to sleep one night, I found myself wandering online and stumbled upon the Facebook page of the Faculty of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at NEU. Out of mere curiosity, I scrolled through all the posts and checked out the interactions. I saw snippets of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence discovery course and pictures from the signing of lab establishments. That&rsquo;s when the idea of choosing NEU began to form in my mind. I joined the Facebook group and the Zalo chat group.</p>
                                <p>I came across Sir H&agrave; Minh Ho&agrave;ng&apos;s profile, where he shared information about a mathematical modeling contest, and I thought about participating. More than anything, I wanted an excuse to visit the Faculty before making my final decision. However, fear held me back; I felt I had no knowledge to compete. I was willing to join just for the experience, but the requirement to have a team made me hesitate. Surely, there were others who wanted to participate to win, and I didn&rsquo;t want to hold them back.</p>
                                <p>When I finally made up my mind, the first round was already eight days in. The question involved a nurse scheduling problem, and with only two days left, I knew I couldn&apos;t tackle it alone. I gathered my courage and asked Mr. Ho&agrave;ng for help. He agreed, and I was called to the lab, where a senior guided me through the problem. It was my first time working with CPLEX, which was quite interesting. The three weeks of Python learning I had just completed proved helpful, which made me feel proud of myself a little bit.</p>
                                <p>The funny part was that I didn&apos;t realize the problem statement spanned two pages (who would think that when the questions were posted online?). I ended up having to finish half of the task at home by myself. Surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly, to be fair I did get outside help), I made it into the top 10 of the high school table and advanced to the second round.</p>
                                <p>During the second round, I was in Taiwan for the entire duration and frankly didn&rsquo;t contribute much. All credit goes to my teammate (I owe him a lot). However, it was fascinating to be introduced to the problem of pandemic simulation and to work through it using MATLAB. While we didn&rsquo;t make it into the top two and become finalists, I found it satisfying enough, knowing that many others were far more deserving (considering we had only known about the whole thing in less than 2 weeks).</p>
                                <p>Anyways, the meeting at the lab was the turning point that made me want to study at NEU. I figured that this is a dynamic environment, which I had long thought was unsuitable for my personality, but I promised myself to change &mdash; I knew I had to.</p>
                                <p>Honestly, I want to engage in the research field as soon as possible, but I&rsquo;ll elaborate more on that in &quot;Final Thoughts.&quot;</p>

                                <p>Those five days were filled with countless trials and errors. It was during this time that I truly realized how far we&rsquo;ve come in terms of creative AI. I experimented with several AI tools, and I had noted them down, so here&rsquo;s a quick list:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Creating Images</strong>: CGDream [<a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://cgdream.ai/">https://cgdream.ai/</a>]</li>
                                    <li><strong>Image/Text to Video</strong>: RunwayML [<a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://runwayml.com/">https://runwayml.com/</a>], Tooncrafter [<a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Doubiiu/tooncrafter">https://huggingface.co/spaces/Doubiiu/tooncrafter</a>]</li>
                                    <li><strong>Watermark Removal</strong>: Media.io [<a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://anieraser.media.io/app">https://anieraser.media.io/app</a>], Vmake [<a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://vmake.ai/">https://vmake.ai/</a>]</li>
                                    <li><strong>AI Filters for Images</strong>: Fotor [<a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://goart.fotor.com/">https://goart.fotor.com/</a>]</li>
                                    <li><strong>Others</strong>: Photoshop, IbisPaint, Background Removal</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For the competition, I opted for start frame - end frame video generation approach (which means the AI will do the sequences in between the 2 frames) rather than relying on prompt engineering (and let the AI dictates everything). I already had a specific set of scene cuts in mind, and I found prompt-based generation didn&rsquo;t align with my vision. One issue was that the characters would often look Westernized, and I lacked control over certain scene-specific details. Plus, any dialogue would have to be in English, which wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted. Paying for premium tools was an option, but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending even $10 for the contest. So, congrats to the first-place winners! I think I stumbled across the tools they used, but their direction wasn&rsquo;t quite what I was after. In the end, <strong>Tooncrafter</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong> were the two primary tools I worked with.</p>
                                <p>In hindsight, maybe a different approach could have been better:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Start with lyrics &rarr; Write music with <strong>Suno AI</strong> &rarr; Create images using <strong>Midjourney AI</strong> based on the music &rarr; Transform those images into a short video using <strong>RunwayML</strong>.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This approach would be costly, but it&rsquo;s something I might experiment with next time&mdash;it seems like it could lead to something really interesting. I came across a video that followed a similar process (without the Midjourney part) after the contest had ended, and it&rsquo;s stuck with me ever since: <a rel="noopener" target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpP6XojxH3g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpP6XojxH3g</a>.</p>

                            <div class="accordion-body"><p>This one is difficult to talk about. The course began with around 45 participants, but by the last day, only 7 remained. While there are many factors, I believe the main issues can be summarized as follows:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><strong>Haste</strong>: As I mentioned earlier, NEU is a highly dynamic environment where everything moves quickly. However, this speed can sometimes come at the cost of thorough preparation and verification, leading to premature implementation.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><strong>Lecturers</strong>: Assigning the teaching role to a student (even an academically excellent one) or someone with no prior teaching experience is rarely a good idea. Teaching, especially introductory material, requires a unique skill set. Many mistakenly believe it&apos;s easier to teach foundational concepts than advanced topics, but I&rsquo;ve come to realize, especially after CS50, that setting a strong foundation requires exceptional skill.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><strong>Program</strong>: The course lacked a clear outline from the beginning, and no one seemed to review the structure before it was delivered.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>There are certainly more points to consider, but I think it&apos;s crucial that we reflect on this experience to prevent future repetitions.</p></div>
